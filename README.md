# Pick-And-Place_OSH_feeder
Contains parts for Open PnP builds/repairs

#FAQ
This contains the spoke-wheel feeder design files, and the ponoko.com laser-etched template. These are designed to take a M3 Tap, and were attached with threaded M3 brass-standoffs to a metal-gear continuos rotation servo motor.  In retrospect, we would recomend using low-carbon steel rather than stainless if possible, as it is likely easier to solder on fasteners.

#Notes
The teeth must always center on the tape, and were designed to friction fit with minimal backlash.  You will find that the tabs will allow the gears to twist out of the sheet, but will need deburred with a file or grinding wheel.

#Advice
Although our group chickened out of this costly build, we released our partial works in hope that the community will find an easier way of building these parts. Please send us your results if you find these files useful, or build something neat. =)

#The laser-etched metal template making process:
1. Clean metal surface with degreaser
2. Lightly Spray paint both sides of sheet metal with green acrylic, and let dry for 24 hours
3. Drill 2 vertically aligned holes though sheet metal, and into  plywood scrap
4. Hammer in pegs or nails into plywood alignment holes
5. Laser etch template pattern intto sheet metal's front side (ablades paint off surfaces) 
6. Flip metal sheet on vertical pegs 
5. Laser etch virtically-flipped template pattern to sheet metal's back side 
6. Wrap thick copper wire though bar-metal drill holes, and cover with plastic tape.
7. Etch outdoors using safe methods (both sides will undercut slightly)
